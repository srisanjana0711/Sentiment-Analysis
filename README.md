# Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on text data using **Deep Learning** techniques. The model classifies input text into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment classes based on contextual understanding, making it applicable in areas like customer reviews, social media monitoring, and feedback analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- Preprocessing of text (tokenization, padding)
- Embedding layers to learn word representations
- LSTM/GRU/RNN (whichever was used in the notebook) for sequence modeling
- Trained model on labeled sentiment dataset
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

---

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Numpy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## ðŸ§° Features

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning: removing stop words, lowercasing, punctuation removal
   - Tokenization and Padding
   - Label encoding

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Embedding layer to convert words to vectors
   - Recurrent layer (LSTM or GRU) to capture text sequence
   - Dense layer with softmax/sigmoid for classification

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Graphical plots for performance

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- The project uses a dataset with labeled text (e.g., reviews, tweets).
- Each text sample is tagged with its corresponding sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- Can be customized or expanded for any domain (e.g., movie reviews, tweets, product feedback).

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Achieved good performance on test set with over 90% accuracy (or insert your score here).
- Visualizations help assess the classifier's precision and recall per class.

## âœ… How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run the cells step-by-step.
3. Upload your dataset in the format:
   - `Text`, `Label` (CSV format preferred)
4. Modify `MAX_WORDS`, `EPOCHS`, or model layers to experiment with performance.
5. Evaluate the model on unseen data.
